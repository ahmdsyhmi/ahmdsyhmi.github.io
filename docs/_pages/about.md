## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ahmad Syahmi

I'm a digital marketer who builds systems that donâ€™t just *look* good â€” they **work hard**.

With 7+ years of experience across health supplements, life science and technical equipment. I specialize in turning complex products into **clear campaigns** that convert â€” whether itâ€™s through SEO-rich content, automated lead funnels, or sales kits that actually get used.

### ðŸ”§ What I Do Best:
- Build **automated workflows** that cut marketing grunt work
- Launch **high-conversion campaigns** across email, web, and social
- Turn raw data into **actionable marketing systems**
- Align cross-functional teams like Sales and Tech Support so everyone closes faster

### ðŸ›  Tools I Actually Use:
- **SEO & Analytics:** Ubersuggest, Ahrefs, Google Analytics
- **Automation:** Generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude AI), Notion-based Integration, Google Sheets scripts
- **Campaigns:** HTML EDMs, Shopify Website Builder, LinkedIn and Meta Ads
- **CRM & Sales Enablement:** Streamlined custom lead management workflows using Notion â€” integrated with task follow-ups, lead status tracking, and post-event handover kits.

### ðŸŽ¯ Recent Wins:
- Drove 80+ qualified leads on customer technical equipment demo requests through an integrated event campaign  
- Revamped FC-BIOSâ€™ entire website and SEO â€” landing 50+ top-3 keywords  
- Enabled cross-department alignment with automated post-event lead workflows  
- Built digital sales toolkits that are now 90% of repsâ€™ go-to assets
